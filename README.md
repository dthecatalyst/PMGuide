# What is a Project ?

According to the Project Management Institute: * "A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result." Let's break down this definition into its components to understand further what a project is (and what it is not):

It is a temporary endeavor - what does that mean? It means that it isn't endless; it has a start date and an end date. Projects do not go on indefinitely. Activities that go on indefinitely are typically known as processes or operations.

It creates a unique product, service, or result, which we call deliverable.
Unique means that it is unlike any other project. It may be similar to other projects but it is never identical to one. This is what distiguishes a project from process. A project is unique; a process is a repeatable and strives for consistency, standardization, and no deviation from standards.
Deliverable means that it has a outcome: i.e. a new product, a new building, a merger of two companies, improved customer service, etc. The outcome may be a product, goods, or a service.

Furthermore, projects have defined...

### Objectives: 
The goals expected to be achieved. There can be technical goals (develop new technology), legal or political goals (to meet governmental regulations), and/or business goals (beating or eliminating competition). These objectives should be measurable.

### Scope: 
All the work required to deliver the product or result and satisfy the objectives for which a project was undertaken at a level of quality expected by the customer. The scope includes all the deliverables required to meet the project objectives.

### Cost: 
The planned cost of conducting the project; it includes human and physical resources. 

### Time/Schedule: 
The planned time to complete the project, as well as the Milestones along the way.

### SOME EXAMPLES OF PROJECTS

   - Building a house
   - Building a mobile application
   - Developing a new product
   - Improvement of a service (i.e. customer service, Six Sigma initiative)



### Now that we've introduced the definition of a project, let's discuss some of the differences between projects and processes (or operations)

   - Let say I'm working in the project department in a company of the renewable energy industry. In my company we will call it a project while the PV plants or Wind farms are under construction. 
   - As defined in the PMBOK Guide, it is temporary and it will deliver a unique product. Once we start producing and selling energy, the responsibility is transferred to the operations team who is will make sure that everything is running smoothly and consistently, according to the procedures already implemented in the company.

### Projects and Processes in Disaster Management

   - Let's say an agency responsible for coordinating mitigation, response and recovery activities for several countries. The agency receives funding for mitigation initiatives or projects- These have specific objectives, timelines and scope. For example, projects can be geared towards improving Early Warning Systems or making schools safer (objectives). These projects can last anywhere between one year and 10 years (timeline) and the scope for implementation varies from one or two countries to all eighteen countries which fall under the agency.

   - On the other hand, the agency has several internal processes which help its effectiveness. A key example would be monitoring and reporting using specialized software. This helps management staff to be aware of how other departments are performing and gives insight as to how the agency can improve on its operations. This happens on a continuous basis. 
   
# What is Project Management?
      
Project Management consists of the methods and tools used to deliver a project that meets its stated objectives. Sounds simple right? Objectives typically represent themselves in terms of cost, time, and scope (also known as the Triple Constraint). As long as we know the objectives, we should be able to meet them, right? It may come as a surprise to you, but often times projects fail to meet their objectives. It isn't so simple because the number of factors that must be controlled can, and often do, interact in unexpected ways. Consequently, the project becomes more complicated as the number of factors increases.

You've encountered projects in your personal life (remodeling a home), in your work (developing a new product for your company), or at school (getting a degree). When remodeling a home, you must watch and control the expenses; when developing a new product, you must monitor the number of features that are added to the product to meet cost expectations; and when getting a degree, you often have to manage your time commitments. Managing the expenses, managing the schedule, managing the amount of work, planning for problems, handling the risks, communicating critical information to all involved, leading a team - these are the activities of successful Project Management.

## The Triple Constraint

Whether complex or simple, high-budget or low-budget, lengthy or brief in time, all projects have the same three general objectives: meeting the scope (including quality criteria of the deliverables), meeting time constraints, and meeting cost boundaries. These three objectives are called the "Triple Constraint." We will refer to the Triple Constraint many times. These three constraints work together in an interesting fashion. They must always be kept in balance with each other - which is one of the biggest challenges that a Project Manager has.

****

### Triple Constraint Example
   Let's say you want to build a house. You want it to be a 3 bedroom house, to be built in 3 months and for no more than $170,000. You first have to design the house with a blueprint, or a plan, for the house you want. Then you have to determine what it will cost to purchase all the materials to build the house to the design. Then you need to ensure you have the proper staff with the proper skills to build the house in 3 months’ time. If you draw your blueprints, and find out to build your dream house, you need $200,000 in materials and labor, then you need to either pick cheaper materials, cheaper or less labor, or change your plan to be less elaborate, maybe build a smaller house, or a reduced scope. If you find your house will take 4 months to build, then you have to have the money in your budget to pay for the extra month of resources, or again, you need to look possibly, at a smaller house which is a reduction in scope, in order to stay within your budget. The Triple Constraint works much like a three legged stool. All three legs must be in balance for the stool to stand up straight and allow for a flat surface to sit on. If one leg gets shortened, the stool starts to tip, same if one leg gets longer than the others. The Triple Constraint works similarly - if one leg gets shortened or lengthened, typically the other two must accommodate or adjust in order to keep the stool in balance which in our case is to achieve the desired objective of the project. Effective Project Managers understand the impact that a change in one constraint has on the other two and manages this continually throughout the project to achieve the desired scope and quality.

## Managing the Triple Constraint

Which constraint, of the Triple Constraint, is the most important for a Project Manager to manage? In theory, they are equally important, but on any particular project, one may be more important than another. A Project Manager must understand their customer and needs to know which of the Triple Constraints may be more important (i.e. meeting the schedule, meeting the budget, or delivering the scope). This becomes important when the Project Manager needs to find solutions to issues or risks encountered and needs to trade off a constraint to meet the project objectives.

Let's look at some examples. The image below represents the Triple Constraint.

<p align="center"><img width="300" height="300" src="Triple_Constraint1.png"></p>

Now let's look at what happens to the project if we have to change one of the constraints.

If your cost is decreased, and you must deliver in the same amount of time, then the impact would be to decrease the scope:

<p align="center"><img width="300" height="300" src="Cost_Decreased_Triple_Constraint2.png"></p>

If your schedule is decreased, and you must provide the same deliverables, the impact would be to increase the cost:

<p align="center"><img width="300" height="300" src="Schedule_Decreased_Triple_Constraint3.png"></p>

If your scope is increased, then the impact would be to either increase the cost or increase the time (or both):

<p align="center"><img width="300" height="300" src="Scope_Increase_Triple_Constraint 4.png"></p>

These examples don't cover every possibility that you might find yourself in as a Project Manager, however, they indicate the importance of recognizing that if one element of the Triple Constraint is impacted, then the two other elements of the Triple Constraint are likely also impacted. The Project Manager must be able to effectively identify these tradeoffs to ensure the best possible decision is made for the business, the customer, and the project.

# What is the Project Life Cycle?
As we mentioned earlier, all projects have a start and an end. Another way to acknowledge this is to say that all projects follow a life cycle of phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution and Closure.
Our goal will be to review and explain how the project is managed throughout these life cycle phases.The concept of a "life cycle" is prevalent in today's business and technology climates. This concept has been applied to the development of most new products, especially software products. Also implicit in a "life cycle," is the notion of phases or stages that are completed in a specific order through the "life" of the project. Each project may go through the same "life cycle" phases, even though each project outcome will be unique. Projects begin with Initiation by defining the goals and objectives to be achieved. In Planning, the details of the project are identified as well as how the project will be carried out in order to meet the objectives. In Execution, the Project Plan is monitored and controlled to ensure that the actual work being delivered meets the planned scope, cost, and schedule. And lastly, the project is Closed where all deliverables are turned over the customer, and all project activities are completed. Project Closing also includes a post project review, complete with a collection of lessons learned, best practices, and improvements that can be made to the Project Management methods and tools for improved performance on future projects in the organization. During each life cycle phase, there are specific deliverables expected to be produced. These deliverables are based upon the project objectives and the ultimate project result. For example, if the project is to build a house, at the end of the Planning Phase it would be expected to have design blueprints for the house as well as a contract with a builder to build the house. During Execution, it would be expected that there would be interim key deliverables such as, the completion of the foundation, the completion of the framing, the completion of the roof, the completion of the walls, the completion of electrical and plumbing, and so forth. These deliverables are produced over the “life” of the project and are key to meeting the overall project goal of a beautiful new home. We will explore the entire Project Life Cycle together, beginning with Initiation and finishing with Project Closing.

## Project Life Cycle Phases
The Project Manager and project team have one shared goal: to carry out the work of the project for the purpose of meeting the project's objectives. A standard project typically has the following major phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution (including monitoring and control), and Closure. Taken together, these phases represent the path a project takes from the beginning to its end and are generally referred to as the project "life cycle." The project life cycle described below is what is known as a Predictive Project Life Cycle.

<p align="center"><img width="600" height="350" src="Project_Life_Cycle_graphic.png"></p>

<p align= "center"><b>Typical Cost and Staffing Levels Across a Generic Project Life Cycle Structure</b></p>

### Initiation Phase

During the first of these phases, the Initiation Phase, the project objective or need is identified; this can be a business problem or opportunity that must be solved. The Project Manager is assigned. The project purpose, objectives and high level requirements are identified and captured in a Project Charter. This includes identifying the project Stakeholders and understanding their role in the project. The Project Charter serves as the basis for the approval of the project to move into the Planning Phase.

### Planning Phase

The next phase, the Planning Phase, is where the project solution is further developed in as much detail as possible and the steps necessary to meet the project's objective are planned. In this phase, the team identifies all of the work to be done. The project's activities and resource requirements are identified, along with the strategy for producing them. This is also referred to as "scope management." A Project Plan is created outlining the activities, dependencies, and timeframes. The Project Manager coordinates the preparation of a project budget by providing cost estimates for the labor, equipment, and materials costs. The budget is used to monitor and control cost expenditures during Project Execution.

Once the project team has identified the work, prepared the schedule, and estimated the costs, the three fundamental components of the planning process are complete. This is an excellent time to identify and try to deal with anything that might pose a threat to the successful completion of the project. This is called risk management. In risk management, "high-threat" potential problems are identified along with the action that is to be taken on each high-threat potential problem, either to reduce the probability that the problem will occur or to reduce the impact on the project if it does occur. This is also the time to document all project Stakeholders and establish a Communication Plan describing the information needed and the delivery method to be used to keep the Stakeholders informed. You will want to document your Resource Plan to identify the materials, supplies, services, and personnel required to ensure a successful project. The Resource Plan includes a Team Plan that documents the availability of the team and how you will create a positive team environment. You will also want to include a Procurement Plan if you plan to procure services or materials. Finally, you will want to document a Quality Plan, providing quality targets, assurance, and control measures, along with an Acceptance Plan, listing the criteria to be met to gain customer acceptance. At this point, the project would have been planned in detail and is ready to be executed.

### Execution Phase (Including monitoring and control)
During the third phase, the Execution Phase, the project plan is put into motion and the work of the project is performed. It is important to maintain control and communicate as needed during Execution. Progress is continuously monitored and appropriate adjustments are made and recorded as variances from the original plan. In any project, a Project Manager spends most of the time in this phase. During project execution, people are carrying out the activities, and progress information is being reported through regular team meetings. The Project Manager uses this information to maintain control over the direction of the project by comparing the progress reports with the project plan to measure the performance of the project activities and take corrective action as needed. The first course of action should always be to bring the project back on course (i.e., to return it to the original plan). If that cannot happen, the team should record variations from the original plan, and record and publish modifications to the plan. Throughout this step, Project Sponsors and other key Stakeholders should be kept informed of the project's status according to the agreed-on frequency and format of communication.

Status reports should always emphasize the anticipated end point in terms of cost, schedule, and quality of deliverables. Each project deliverable produced should be reviewed for quality and measured against the acceptance criteria. Once all of the deliverables have been produced and the customer has accepted the final solution, the project is ready for Closure.

### Closing phase
During the final Closure Phase, or Completion Phase, the emphasis is on releasing the final deliverables to the customer, handing over project documentation to the business, terminating supplier contracts, releasing and reassigning project resources to other work or projects, and communicating the closure of the project to all Stakeholders. The last remaining step is to conduct lessons-learned studies in a post project review to examine what went well and what didn't. Through this type of analysis, the wisdom of experience is transferred back to the project organization, which will help future project teams.

# The Role and Characteristics of a Project Manager


Project Managers are found in all industries and types of work. Their job includes the management of the Triple Constraint as we have previously discussed. Their job is also to lead a project team and be effective in managing relationships and communications with everyone involved and affected by the project. There is a management component to being a Project Manager as schedules, scope, risk, quality, and budgets must all be managed. In addition, Project Managers need leadership skills as they lead a project team, negotiate contracts, resolve issues and problems, and meet expectations of Stakeholders. The ability to successfully negotiate with others for resources, time, and money can be critical to project success. The ability to lead a team of talented, strong-willed people is another key to success. Leadership requires leadership skills and behavioral skills (aka "soft skills").

It is important for the Project Manager to understand and be able to apply Project Management techniques and tools, to have a good sense of the organization's business goals, and maintain an accurate budget, but that is not enough. An effective, competent Project Manager needs excellent political, interpersonal, communication, leadership, and mediation skills.

One of the most important jobs of the Project Manager is to manage the risks inherent in the project. This means seriously thinking about what can go wrong with the project and creating backup plans to deal with the unexpected events. Constantly asking, "What if...?" This means:

   - Having a plan in place to handle team conflict.
   - Having a plan in place to deal with a customer always wanting to make changes.
   - Having a plan in place to mentor and coach poor performers on your team.
   - Having a plan in place to deal with possible quality issues.
   - Having a plan in place to develop a collaborative relationship with other managers.

As you can see, the role of the Project Manager goes far beyond their ability to manage a project schedule. The best project schedule in the world still won't help a Project Manager that has poor communication skills. With these skills in mind, let's take a look at the role of the Project Manager in contrast to other managers within an organization.

## Project Managers Compared to Functional Managers

When we think of managers, usually we think of the functional manager or the department manager- the person who manages an organizational unit such as marketing, accounting & payroll, research, human resources,manufacturing, facilities, and so on. These units provide products or services to all areas of the organization, and usually specialize in producing one type of result, product, or service. Functional groups are also typically responsible for company operations within their specialization area. The manager of these functional units is usually a specialist in the function that the department represents.

On the other hand, a Project Manager is more of an integrator, working with and drawing people from across functional units. The Project Manager by necessity must use a broad approach; he or she collects skills and talents across functional departments and assembles a team of people and talents that will be used to tackle the project. The Project Manager does not need to be a specialist, although the members of his/her team must be.

As an integrator, the Project Manager faces demands that the functional manager never sees, such as:

   - Resource allocation conflicts
   - Motivating "borrowed" personnel
   - Constantly making trade-offs between goals and constraints
   - Working with new, untried, and possibly undeveloped technology
   - Negotiating with people in the organization, at every level, who may or may not want to collaborate.

This is why Project Managers must have many competencies - as a manager, as a leader, as an employee, as a business person.
